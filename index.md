 The battle of bunker hill took place on June 17th, 1775. It was a battle between Great Britain and the Rebel colonists. It took place in the hills near Charlestown which is just across the bay from Boston. The battle was a victory for the British, but a bloody one. They lost over 1000 men, more than double the American casualties. For the Americans, it was a major morale-boosting win. Even though they lost their position, it proved to them that the British could be defeated and that was not in fact invincible.

###### Timeline
The first event of the timeline would be British generals deciding to use the hills around Charlestown to have full control over the 
    harbor and a way to break out of the city. Then, American spies learn of the plan and pass it on to the American generals. Then 
    American generals send troops to fortify a hilltop named bunker hill, but they ended up fortifying a hill called breeds hill. After 
    that British troops landed on the Charlestown peninsula and camped out for the night. Then the colonist forces got to the hill and
    begin fortifying it sneakily. In the morning of June 17th, British troops saw the fortifications and begin an assault on it. After 
    about 3 waves of British assaults, the colonist ran out of ammunition and were forced to retreat. Most of the American casualty’s 
    were killed during the retreat because it was less of an orderly retreat and more of a rout. When there is a rout, everyone just
    runs away and that let the British fire volley after volley into the Americans while they ran with little resistance because they 
    couldn’t shoot back. After this, the British take control over the hill and bring up cannons to set up on the hill to retain 
    control of the harbor and for bombardment purposes. ![2 15 19 ela project timeline](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47544167/52831606-3942ea80-30a3-11e9-8441-1fcddb3bd966.png)


###### Geography
The area the battle was fought in was on a hill. It was situated on a peninsula near Boston and near the town of Charlestown. 
    The geography was quite important because it is what caused the battle. If the hill had not been there, the battle probably
    would not have been fought and more likely if it has the British forces would have won with ease. This Map shows how the American
    defense was set up and how the British attacked and the general area around the battle. Charlestown had been burned before the 
    battle so there were only ruins there.![array_of_american_forces_on_the_field_at_the_battle_of_breeds_hill 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47544167/52831643-6394a800-30a3-11e9-9922-1720897d2d80.png)


###### Causes/Issues
The reason the British wanted and needed the hill was to break out of Boston.
At the time of the battle, Boston was locked down by 12,000 militiamen, effectively besieging it. Because of this, the
    British needed a way to break out of the city and start retaking land from the colonists. But because of the colonist 
    stranglehold on the only land access to Boston, the British had to find an external route into Massachusetts in order to break
    out of the pocket they were in. This caused them to turn to the Charlestown peninsula to break out of Boston and began advancing
    through the colonies. But when the Americans learned of this, they immediately recognized the impact the British could have on the
    battle if they were able to fire cannons at the colonist and therefore sent a detachment to gain and control the hill. The colonists
    also figured out that they could bring heavy artillery down from fort Ticonderoga and begin shelling the British defenses from afar
    and begin driving out the British form Boston 

###### Personalities and Groups 
 The Two main combatants would be the rebel colonists and the British empire. Due to the battle being fought in Boston, these were the
    only two real forces. The British empire would have been the ones who were attacking bunker hill while the Americans would have 
    been the ones defending it from the British forces. Each side had their commanders and generals but For the British side, the most
    famous would have been Thomas Gage. He was the one who formulated the plan to take the hills and then march out of Boston and break
    the siege. His plan may have worked if he had not so grossly underestimated the American forces and had been more secretive of
    his planning. On the Americans side, you have William Prescot, the general who took control of the hill during the night and
    fortified it. He was a good commander, but due to the general disarray of the American troops at that time, his orders were often 
    ignored or not even received. But a possibly more famous man, William Prescott, was a colonel who was at the battle of bunker hill
    and was famous for yelling “Don’t fire until you see the whites of their eyes!” Which means fire when there almost right on top of
    you. This line is very heavily associated with the battle.

###### The issue of territorial expansion 
The issue of territorial expansion drives this whole conflict. The Americans wanted to have control over the 13 colony’s
    while the British wanted their resource rich colony’s back. This was an issue at the battle of bunker hill because the
    Americans wanted to have control over Boston, a major port city while the British wanted to use Boston to march through the 
    colony’s and put down the rebellion. The issue of territorial expansion was quite important to the battle of bunker hill. 
    Without it, the British may have Easily taken back the colonels if Britain had decided to take bunker hill and America had
    not. If the Americans had not sieged Boston, America probably would have fallen. If the American colonist had not wanted to 
    expand their territory as much as possible and taken as much as they could of the British, then America would probably very 
    different today. Britain was always on the lookout for more area to expand into and probably would have taken it. Without
    Americas urge to control itself and the land around it, America would not exist today because it would have been torn to shreds 
    and divided up by the European powers.
    
  ###### Legacy 
The legacy that bunker hill has is that Americans fought the British, an overwhelming foe and against all odds beat them. While they lost the ground they had, the rebel colonists had beaten the British hard and proved to themselves that they could and would do it and defeat the British empire. The battle of bunker hill resulted in a very proud people because they had won against a global superpower with a group of scrounged up farmers. This aided in creating a very prideful and almost a little prejudiced national identity to other countries.
