###### THE BATTLE OF BUNKER HILL
     ###### By Max Seijn

The Battle of Bunker Hill took place on June 17th, 1775. It was a battle between Great Britain and the American colonists. It took place in the hills near Charlestown, Massachusetts, which is just across the bay from Boston. The battle was a victory for the British in terms of territory gained, but a bloody one. They lost over 1,000 men, more than double the number of American casualties. For the Americans, it was a major morale-boosting win. Even though they lost their position, it proved to them that the British were not, in fact, invincible and could be defeated.

###### Timeline
1.	The first event of the timeline would be British generals deciding to use the hills around Charlestown to gain full control over Boston harbor and a way to break out of the city. 
2.	American spies learn of the British plan and pass the information on to the American generals. 
3.	American generals send troops to fortify a hilltop named Bunker Hill, but they end up fortifying a hill called Breed’s Hill. 
4.	 British troops landed on the Charlestown peninsula and camped out for the night. 
Colonist forces arrived at Breed’s Hill and began quietly fortifying through night in anticipation of a British attack. 
5.	On the morning of June 17th, 1775, British infantry troops saw the American fortifications and began an assault on Breed’s Hill. 
6.	Many British soldiers were killed in the initial attacks up Breed’s Hill, as the Americans had a superior position and cover. But, after two unsuccessful waves of British assaults, the colonists ran out of ammunition and were forced to retreat off the Charlestown Peninsula to American blockades in the Boston area. Most of the American casualties occurred during this retreat, as it was disordered and panicked, more of a rout than a retreat. The American forces basically ran away as the British fire volley after volley into the militiamen, who had no way to fight back or resist as they had no ammunition. 
7.	The British took control of Breed’s Hill and Bunker Hill and brought cannons up the hills to retain control of the Boston Harbor as well as to shell American positions around Boston. 

###### Geography
The area the battle was fought in was on a hill. It was situated on a peninsula near Boston and near the town of Charlestown. The geography was quite important because it is what caused the battle. If the hill had not been there, the battle probably would not have been fought and more likely if it has the British forces would have won with ease. This Map shows how the American defense was set up and how the British attacked and the general area around the battle. Charlestown had been burned before the battle so there were only ruins there.

 

###### Causes/Issues
The reason the British wanted and needed Breed’s and Bunker Hills was to break out of Boston and begin taking back territory surrounding Boston. At the time of the battle, Boston was locked down by 12,000 American militiamen, effectively besieging it, keeping the British contained. Because of this, the British needed a way to get out of the city and start retaking land from the colonists. But because of the colonist stranglehold on the only land access to Boston, the British had to find an external route into Massachusetts in order to break out of the pocket they were in. This caused them to turn to the Charlestown peninsula to break out of Boston and began advancing through the colonies. But when the Americans learned of this, they immediately recognized the impact the British could have on the battle if they were able to fire cannons at the colonist and therefore sent a detachment to gain and control the hill. The colonists also figured out that they could bring heavy artillery down from Fort Ticonderoga and begin shelling the British defenses from afar and begin driving out the British from Boston 



###### Personalities and Groups 
 The two main combatants would be the American colonists and the British Empire. Due to the battle being fought in Boston, these were the only two true forces. The British Empire attacked Bunker Hill (and Breed’s Hill) while the Americans defended it. Each side had their commanders and generals, but for the British, the most famous was General Thomas Gage. He was the one who formulated the plan to take the hills and then march out of Boston and break the siege. His plan may have worked if he had not so grossly underestimated the capabilities of the Americans and if he had been more careful about who he talked to about his plans. 
On the American side, General Israel Putnam was the general who took control of Breed’s during the night and fortified it without the British noticing. He was a good commander, but due to the disarray of the American troops at that time, his orders were not always carried out. But a possibly more famous man, Colonel William Prescott, was the officer in control of the detachment of troops at Breed’s Hill. He his known for ordering his troops “Don’t fire until you see the whites of their eyes!” This means hold your fire until the British troops are almost on top of you, so you will kill more of them. This is the most famous quote associated with the battle.

###### The Issue of Territorial Expansion 
The issue of territorial expansion drives this whole conflict. The Americans wanted to have control over the 13 colony’s while the British wanted their resource-rich colony’s back. This was an issue at the battle of bunker hill because the Americans wanted to have control over Boston, a major port city while the British wanted to use Boston to march through the colony’s and put down the rebellion. The issue of territorial expansion was quite important to the battle of bunker hill. Without it, the British may have Easily taken back the colonels if Britain had decided to take bunker hill and America had not. If the Americans had not sieged Boston, America probably would have fallen. If the American colonist had not wanted to expand their territory as much as possible and take as much as they could of the British, then America would probably very different today. Britain was always on the lookout for more area to expand into and probably would have taken it. Without Americas urge to control itself and the land around it, America would not exist today because it would have been torn to shreds and divided up by the European powers.


###### Constitutional Principals 
The Constitutional principle that is most closely related to this event is the idea of republicanism. It is like this because of the men fighting the battle. They were fighting for freedom form the suppressive English crown. The reason the battle of bunker hill took place was to push the English forces out of Boston and away from America. The whole war was based around people wanting to be able to decide on what happens in the government. This principle of federalism was one of the biggest the constitution was based around. The battle of bunker hill was fought in order to establish a new government based around the people, not a select few. Bunker hill played a role as a massive morale boost to those who were fighting with Americans and Americans who wanted to be free of the oppressive grip of the British Empire upon them. Federalism is what caused the battle of bunker hill and it caused the united states of America 



###### Legacy
The legacy that bunker hill has is that Americans fought the British, an overwhelming foe and against all odds beat them. While they lost the ground they had, the rebel colonists had beaten the British hard and proved to themselves that they could and would do it and defeat the British empire. The battle of bunker hill resulted in very proud people because they had won against a global superpower with a group of scrounged up farmers. This aided in creating a very prideful and almost a little prejudiced national identity to other countries. The battle of bunker hill became a symbol of American muscle and pride and how anyone could defat anything with enough minds set on it.
